                        <strong>Feedback from Stakeholders:</strong>
                         After interviewing two of the students in Westwood College. The students were looking for simplicity in the website design (Not Crowded), and also how easy it is to follow the links. The students informed us that they have found the simplicity in the design of the wireframe, and also it was very easy to follow the feedback task. Finally, we got the approval from the students and other instructors in the school of Technology.
